<h2>Examine Organism Dialog</h2>
<p>
When you double-click on an organism, this dialog will appear.
This dialog shows the inner details of an organism.
<P>

<P>
<IMG SRC="ViewOrganism.jpg">
<P>

The ORGANISM area of this dialog displays stuff common to the entire organism. The CELL
area displays the stuff unique to that cell. To examine different cells, click on
the cell you want to view.
<P>

<H3>ORGANISM</H3>
This section shows various details about the organism. The genetic
program (which is shared among all the cells) is shown in the text
control. The highlighted instruction is where the selected cell is
currently executing.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Organism ID:</B> Every organism is assigned a unique 64-bit ID number. This
	ID increments as organisms are created. This field displays this organisms
	unique ID.
<P>

<LI> <B>Parent 1:</B> ID value for the first parent (and only parent if this organism
	was created asexually).
<P>

<LI> <B>Parent 2:</B> ID value for the second parent (if this organism
	was created sexually). It will be blank if this organism was
	created asexually.
<P>

<LI> <B>Generation</B> The generation of this organism all the way back to the first
	organism. We compute this field based on the parents 'generation':
<PRE>
	generation = MAX(parent1.generation, parent2.generation) + 1
</PRE>
<P>

<LI> <B># of cells:</B> The number of cells in this organism.
<P>

<LI> <B># of living children:</B> number of organism that have this organism as a parent.
<P>

<LI> <B>Age:</B> The number of simulation steps this organism has survived through.
<P>

<LI> <B>Energy:</B> How much energy does this organism have? This excludes the amount of energy
	that went into stack elements.
<P>

<LI><B>Strain #:</B> This is the strain number for the whole organism. The color of the organism
is also a clue to its strain.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

<H3>CELL</H3>
This section shows the state of the cell you have selected in the
display window. Use your mouse to select different cells. The
current cell is highlighted with a blue rectangle.
<P>
These fields comprise the "execution context". Each cell has its own copy of these fields:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Code Block:</B> This specifies the code block currently being executed by
	this cell. Code block numbers begin at 0. Code block zero is normally labeled "main:", and
	subsequent code blocks are labeled "row1, row2, row3, ...".
<P>

<LI><B>Program Counter:</B> This is the instruction offset within the code block. This counter
	begins at 0. If program counter refers to the last instruction plus 1, then this
	cell has just reached the end of a code block.
<P>

<LI><B>R0 - R9:</B> General Purpose registers. Can be set with the instructions
	<B>Rn!, R0!, R1!, R2!, ...</B> and the cell can fetch a register value
	with the instructions <B>Rn, R0, R1, R2, ...</B>.
<P>

<LI><B>Mood:</B> This is like a general purpose register. The cell can set this field by
	using the <B>MOOD!</B> instruction. Other cells can query our mood by using the
	<B>MOOD</B> instruction.
<P>

<LI><B>Location:</B> The grid location of this cell.
<P>

<LI><B>Message:</B> Like a general purpose register except other cells can set this field by
	using the <B>SEND</B> and <B>BROADCAST</B> instructions. This cell can fetch the value
	of this field by using the <B>RECV</B> instruction.
<P>

<LI><B>Cell:</B> The cell number within the organism.
<P>

<LI><B>Data Stack:</B> Like the Forth programming language, this stack is used to
keep track of data items that the cell is using for computation.
The top of this list box represents the top of the stack.
<P>

<LI><B>Call Stack:</B> Like the Forth programming language, this stack
contains the call history. As code blocks are entered/exited this stack grows
 The top of this list box represents the top of the stack.and shrinks.
<P>

</UL>
<P>

<H3>BUTTONS:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Vision Data:</B> This button will pop up another dialog showing
the vision data that the KFORTH instructions LOOK, WHERE, WHAT, NEAREST, FARTHEST.
<A HREF="vision_dialog.html">See vision dialog</A> for more information.
<P>

<LI><B>Step:</B> This button will simulate the universe for 1 step. The current
instruction about to execute is highlighted. In this way
you can observe the inner workings of a genetic program.
(Function key: <B>F11</B>).
<P>

<LI><B>Step Over:</B> This button will simulate the universe for 1 step, but step
over any subroutine calls. (Function key: <B>F10</B>).
<P>

<LI><B>Run:</B> Begin running the program (actually this begins simulating the whole
universe). Stop when the cell dies, or when a breakpoint is reached.
(Function key: <B>F5</B>).
<P>

<LI><B>Breakpoint:</B> Insert a breakpoint at the current cursor position. Just
select an instruction and press this button. A breakpoint will be added (or removed).
A breakpoint will show up as a vertical bar '|' next to the instruction.
<P>
Breakpoints only apply to the current cell being debugged. When you switch cells, the
breakpoints are retained, and will be applied to the new cell.
(Function key: <B>F9</B>).
<P>

<LI><B>Clear Breakpoints:</B> All breakpoints will be cleared.
(Function key: <B>F8</B>).
<P>

<LI><B>Instructions:</B> This button will pop up a list of KFORTH instructions
for your reference. Whatever instruction the cursor is pointing to will be displayed
in the KFORTH Instruction dialog.
<P>
</UL>
<HR>

<H2>XY Organisms</H2>
If the organism was created using the special <b>"xy*99"</B> strings, then the text <B>XY</B> will appear
in the lower right corner of the dialog. Like so,
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="xy_examine.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>
XY organisms can only reproduce by fertilizing spores that were created by other
organisms (not itself). This means <B>sexual reproduction only</B>. Asexual reproduction is
not possible for these types of organisms. See the section
on <A HREF="xy_simulations.html">XY Simulations</A> for more information on how to create such
organisms.
<P>

<HR>

<H2>Vision Data Dialog</H2>
Pressing the <B>[Vision Data >>]</B> button will display the following dialog. This
dialog shows all the current vision data that will be used by the KFORTH instructions pertaining
to vision (LOOK, WHAT, WHERE, NEAREST, FARTHEST).
<P>
<IMG SRC="VisionDialog.jpg">
<P>
See <A HREF="vision_dialog.html">vision dialog</A> for more information.
<HR>

<H2>KFORTH Instruction Help Dialog</H2>
If you click on <B>[Instructions]</B> the following pop-up dialog will appear. This
is for reference only.
