<h3>3D Explorer</h3>
<IMG SRC="ss3d_3.jpg">
<P>
Clicking on the the <IMG BORDER=1 SRC="tb_3d.jpg"> button will display this first person perspective
of your simulaton. You can even watch the simulation in real-time. (click
<A HREF="3dexplorer.html">here</A> to learn how to use the the 3D explorer).

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>Viewing Organisms</h3>
<IMG SRC="vobig.jpg">
<P>
Next to the main simulation window, this is the second most important display in the simulator.
You can view the entire state of any organism.
Show here is an organism that consists of many cells. All cells share the same KFORTH program.
However each cell has its own execution context (stack, registers, program counter, etc...). This means
different cells and be executing different parts of the same genetic program. (like life on earth).
<P>
You can click on each cell to view its own individual state information. You can single step through
an organism by clicking on 'Step'. Debugging features allow you to completely study how an organism works.
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>Vision Data</h3>
<IMG SRC="VisionDialog.jpg">
<P>
This dialog appears when you click on the <B>[Vision Data >>]</B> button from the
previous dialog. This screen allows you to see the distances and types of objects that the
cell is will "see" when it executes a vision related instruction (such as "LOOK").
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>Universe Properties</h3>
<IMG SRC="ViewUniverse.jpg">
<P>
This dialog just summarizes the current state of the universe. It contains a useful
set of statistics about the current simulation. Memory Usage computes how much RAM is being
used internally to represent this simulation (all values in bytes). We use commas to display numbers,
because they tend to get very large and this makes it easier to read them.
<P>Also, Evolve uses 64-bit integers (instead of 32-bit), this effectively eliminates any possibility of integer
overflow during an extended simulation run.

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>KFORTH Interpreter</h3>
<IMG SRC="KforthInterpreter.jpg">
<P>
This dialog lets you experiment with the KFORTH language. You can write simple programs and single step
through them to see how KFORTH works. This dialog shows the source code and also how that
source code is compiled (in the disassembly window).
<p>
The basic architecture of a KFORTH machine is a DATA stack and a CALL stack. Also each KFORTH machine
has 10 general purpose registers ('R0' - 'R9'). Each data value is a signed 64-bit integer
(in C/C++ this is known as a <b>long long</b>, or <b>_int64</b> data type).
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>KForth Instructions Help</h3>
<IMG SRC="KforthInstructions.jpg">
<P>
You can get help for all the KFORTH instructions (including the instructions used
to control the organisms). This dialog is activated when the user clicks on the
<b>[INSTRUCTIONS]</b> button.
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>New Simulation</h3>
<IMG SRC="NewUniverse.jpg">
<P>
This dialog is used to create a new simulation. The width and height configures the size of
your universe. Seed is used to initialize the random number generator. This means that others
can reproduce your results by using the same seed number (as well as the other initial settings
from this dialog).
<P>
You can add 8 strains to a new simulation. Each strain has its own color, and you
can see which strains succeed over time. Strains cannot interbreed.
<P>
The KFORTH program is the initial genetic program that the first organism starts out with.
Energy is the amount of energy the universe will have. This number remains constant throughout
the simulation.
<P>
Rather than a blank rectangle for your universe, the "Oval Barrier" will place a oval around the
entire universe.
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>Mutations</h3>
<IMG SRC="SimulationOptions.jpg">
<P>
This screen lets you configure the mutations rates. Mutations
are broken down into several types. The percentage represents
the probability that that type of mutation will occur during
the birth of an organism.
<P>
The last step in creating a new organism is to pass its genetic program (inherited without
mutations from one or two parents) through our mutation algorithm. This algorithm
uses these percentages to determine the probability that one of these errors will be introduced
into the new organisms genetic program.

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>Find Dialog</h3>
<IMG SRC="FindDialog.jpg">
<P>
The find feature is a powerful tool for searching your simulation using
complex criteria. (See <A HREF="find_dialog.html">Find Dialog</A> to learn more).
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>Strain Population</h3>
<IMG SRC="StrainPopulation.jpg">
<P>
This dialog shows the population of each strain in your simulation.

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h3>Key</h3>
<IMG BORDER=1 SRC="key.jpg">
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Living Cells:</B> These are cells that are alive! They are part of an organism, and these
types of squares can move, look, eat, and generally do what living things do.
<P>

<LI> <B>Dead Cells:</B> A cell that has just died will be colored red. Then it will either disappear
completely, or turn in to "food" (a white square).
<P>

<LI> <B>Selected Organism:</B> By left clicking on a living cell the user can select an organism.
A selected organism can be copied, cut, pasted, or examined.
<P>

<LI> <B>Food:</B> Food, or organic material is created when an organism is partially killed and
it remains are left behind. This decaying organic material contains energy and can be eaten.
<P>

<LI> <B>Spores:</B> Organisms create spores in order to reproduce. In many cases the first spore
is created (shown here as a blue square), but the spore has not been fertilized yet. These spores
can be eaten, or another organism can place another spore in the same location, which will create
a new organism.
<P>

<LI> <B>Barrier:</B> Barrier can be created by the user. Organisms cannot pass through them.
Barriers can be created to limit migration of organisms between different regions.
<P>
