<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>
Ready? Okay, launch the application and this is what you'll see:
<P>
<IMG SRC="start1.jpg">

<P>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>
There's a thing called a menu, and one of them is called 'File' and if you
click on it, you'll see what is called a sub-menu which contains several choices.
Click on 'New' to create your very first simulation. (You could also click on the 
tool bar button <IMG BORDER=1 SRC="tb_new.jpg">).
<P>
<IMG SRC="start2.jpg">
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>
A Seed value (based on the system timer) has already been filled in. You can specify a value
if you are trying to reproduce a simulation.
<P>
You can select any width x height
you wish (up to a maximum of 3000 units). For this example, we will keep the
default 700 x 600. The Oval Barrier option will create a pleasant
enclosure for your universe (instead of a basic rectangle).
<P>
Unless you know how to write KFORTH programs, it will be best to select 'seed.kf'
which is the starting program I use for all my simulations. This is text file which
you can look at using the "KFORTH Interpreter".
<P>
Energy is an important value for controlling the population of your universe.
Values between 30,000 to 60,000 will give you a population of about 3,000 - 8,000 organisms.
Here we have entered 100,000.
<P>
For this introduction we will just specify one strain, but up to eight can be used.
<p>
Oh, please note that commas are allowed inside of these edit controls. (Cool eh?)
<P>
<IMG SRC="start3.jpg">
<P>

<P>

<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>
Here is the universe that you created. The circle is the "oval barrier" that was created. The
tiny square in the middle is your first organism.
<P>
<IMG SRC="start4.jpg">
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>
Let's start the simulator. How? Click on the <IMG BORDER=1 SRC="tb_start.jpg"> button or
use the menu "Start Simulation" (Or press F1).
<P>
<IMG SRC="start5.jpg">
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>
Well, after a few minutes you should see something similar to this. Cool eh?
Press <IMG BORDER=1 SRC="tb_stop.jpg"> to stop the simulation (or press F4).
Let's zoom in to get a better look at our universe.
<P>
<IMG SRC="start6.jpg">
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Step 7</h2>
<p>
To zoom, use your mouse wheel. Or click on the toolbar button <IMG BORDER=1 SRC="tb_zoomin.jpg">.
Keep zooming in until it looks like this:
<P>
<IMG SRC="start7.jpg">
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Step 8</h2>
<p>
Much nicer. You can actually see individual organisms. You can use your mouse to pan around, by
clicking on the left mouse button and dragging the universe around. (The arrow keys also work for
panning). Let's zoom in a little more,
<P>
<IMG SRC="start8.jpg">
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Step 9</h2>
<p>
Use your mouse and click on a yellow (or red) square. These are organisms and
the most common task in this simulator is to examine the inner genetics of an organism.
<p>
Clicking on an organism "selects" it. If it was a really cool organism, you could cut/copy it
and paste it into another simulation window. But we are going to examine it.
<P>
<IMG SRC="start9.jpg">
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Step 10</h2>
<p>
Using the menu select "VIEW > ORGANISM". Alternatively you could have pressed the
<IMG BORDER=1 SRC="tb_examine.jpg"> tool bar button. (or pressed F8). You can also just double-click
on any organism to view it.
<P>
<IMG SRC="start10.jpg">
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<h2>Step 11</h2>
<p>
This dialog shows everything about the organism. You view its genetic program and various
other details about it. Well, I hope you enjoyed this introduction. Congratulations,
you have just experienced 80% of the application.
<P>

<P>
Clicking on the <B>[Vision Data >>]</B> button will display the cells current
vision data:
<P>
<IMG SRC="VisionDialog.jpg">
<P>
This dialog shows the distance and type of thing that is visible in 8 directions surrounding
the cell. This is used for debugging organisms that do a lot of LOOK'ing.
