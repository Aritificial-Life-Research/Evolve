<h2>History of Evolve</h2>

<h4>Timeline:</h4>
<UL>
<LI> <B>1996 - Evolve 1.0</B><BR>
Written in C on a sun3 workstation. No visualization. I had to
use a perl script to convert the simulation to Post Script and then use GNU GhostScript (gs)
to view snapshots of the universe.
<P>

<LI> <B>1998 - Evolve 2.0</B><BR>
Ported the original code to Borland Builder C/C++ on a PC. Implemented
a decent GUI to visualize the universe. Added new instructions, and tweaked the simulation.
<P>

<LI> <B>2001 - Evolve 3.0 </B><BR>
Rewritten in Eiffel as a learning exercise. Many concepts added to the simulator (like
"energy" and "barriers"). A decent GUI to visualize the universe. Added new instructions,
and tweaked the simulation. The old webpage for Evolve 3.0 is still available
<A HREF="http://www.stauffercom.com/evolve">here</A>.
<P>

<LI> <B>2006 - Evolve 4.0 </B><BR>
This version. For performance reasons Eiffel was dropped as the implementation and
another complete rewrite in C/C++. This time the genetic language was massively improved, and SEX
was added!!!! None of the original code was reused for this version.
<P>
</UL>


<h4>Version 1.0</h4>
In 1996 I read a wonderful book by Richard Dawkins, <I>The Blind Watchmaker</I> that
in addition to providing a clear description of the workings of evolution
it also described some interesting computer software called <I>biomorphs</I>.
His biomorphs would evolve by mutating a small set of genes through successive
generations. However the selection process was user controlled. The
user selected organisms based on whatever criteria they wished.
<P>
I got to thinking that it would be more interesting to have a complete simulation of
evolution, including a selection process that was based on only one criteria: <B>Survival</B>.
I also wanted a more sophisticated mechanism for genes. In biomprphs the genetics were limited
to four of five genes (which were just integers).
<P>
Richard Dawkins' description of the power of cummulative selection was so convincing that
I imagined that a sufficiently good simulation of this process would eventually evolve some
very "smart" creatures. And this was the inspiration for this software.
<P>
My idea was to create a simple 2-dimensional universe using finite elements. Conceptually
the universe would consist of discrete locations (Such as (0,0), (5,4), etc...). There
would not be any bounds to this universe (a feature that has since been dropped in version 4.0),
and creatures could roam in virtually unlimited directions North, South, East and West.
The entities that would inhabit this simple world consisted of organisms. Every organism
would occupy one or more locations. The organism would be a series of cells that all had
to be physically located next to each other.
<P>
Each organism would consist of a genetic program. Each instruction would encapsulate
a very simple operation. For example the instruction <B>"REPRODUCE NORTH(#10)"</B> would cause
the organism to spawn a copy (with possible mutations) 10 units north of the cell that
executed the instruction. Other operations included: <B>MOVE</B>, <B>CONSUME</B>, <B>NEW</B>, <B>DIE</B>.
To make the range of behaviors that could evolve more interesting I included GOTO and
a few other instructions that were purely programmatic in nature.
<P>
In 1996, I had a spare Sun3 workstation that I hoped to run this simulator for months at a time, and
periodically I would examine the current universe to see what "smart" creatures had evolved.
<P>

<h4>Version 2.0</h4>
The initial version was not very good. For one thing I didn't
have any GUI. The only way to examine the universe was to dump the state of the
universe to a text file. I had to use a perl script that converted my simulation files
into postscript (which I could then view using Ghostscript).
But the results and interactivity was lacking.
<P>
So two
years later in 1998 I pulled to orginal code off of my Sun workstation (which was
headed for a Sunnyvale landfill) and decided to port it to Borland Builder C++.
It was very easy to get a simple GUI going and I was very
excited to run a simulation and be able to see the simulation results.
<P>
During this time I enhanced the instruction set. I realized that in real-life organisms,
each cell has a state seperate from the other cells. You nerve cells are different from
your skin cells. I added registers and flags and a stack to each cell.
The genetic program was shared by all cells in the organism (just like our DNA is common
to cells, but each cell does different things based on state).
<P>
I continued to enhance this version. I added many nice GUI features like zoom, cut/paste.
I would periodically revisit this program and run simulations for a couple of days but
I never seemed to evolve anything very interesting.
<P>
One of the problems was the unbounded universe. The creatures would just move in a single
direction and go off into inifinity. My model for rewarding organisms with energy if they
consume other organisms had problems. It was unstable. Depending on the parameters I used,
I either got an exponential growth of organisms (and the machine would run out of memory).
Or the creatures would die off quickly.
<P>
I continued to tweak my universe model. I added a "crowded cells" parameter so that
if the carrying capacity of the simulation reached a certain level, then it would become
harder and harder for organisms to reproduce. The amount of energy needed to reproduce
would dynamically change based on the total number of cells in the universe.
<P>
Anyway, after sufficient tweaking the simulation began to exhibit the characteristics
of cummulative selection, and I was happy.
<P>

<h4>Version 3.0</h4>
In 2001, I decided to re-implement the entire simulator application in Eiffel. The main
goal was to learn eiffel. But I made several improvements to the program during this
time. One improvment was adding "barriers" to the universe. A BARRIER is a way to limit
the universe to a enclosed region. When I ran the simulator with an enclosure, I began
to see much more evolution of smart creatures. They moved around more, and they would
change their direction and interact strangely with other creatures.
<P>
Unfortunately the Eiffel implementation was my first large scale Eiffel program. It
suffered from many problems. Mostly it couldn't handle the constant creation/destruction
of objects during the simulation. I love Eiffel, but damn if this app. was just too slow
for my needs. Here's the old website for <A HREF="http://www.stauffercom.com/evolve">evolve 3.0</A>.

<h4>Version 4.0</h4>
In 2006, I rewrote the whole thing in C/C++. I hate C++, but I guess over the years
I have warmed up to it enough to use it. I do appreciate C++'s performance advantage over
Eiffel. And with lots and lots of ASSERT()'s you can protect yourself from endless hours
of debugging. This is the latest and greatest version.
<P>
Version 4.0 is much improved:
<UL>
<LI> Uses a Forth-like genetic language.
<LI> Each cell can execute in a virtual machine with unlimited data/call stack
<LI> Made replication a 2-step process involving spores, and supports both sexual and asexual reproduction.
<LI> Cleaner GUI.
<LI> Simulation files are platform independent.
<LI> The command line simulator can run on Linux (or any unix) as well as windows.
<LI> More accessable source code for better hacking.
	(Eiffel is still kind of a niche language for most hackers).
<LI> More flexible instructions for controlling the organism
<LI> A better LOOK primitive which is not limited to up/down/left/right directions.
<LI> Grid movement is extended to include diagonals. (not limited to up, down, left and right anymore)
<LI> Much faster than previous implementations.
</UL>
