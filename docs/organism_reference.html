<P>
Refer to this figure for the descriptions of the following instructions.
The <b>mood</b> register is something the cell sets, and others can look at. The <b>message</b> register
is something that others set, and this cell looks at.
<P>
Using the instructions <B>pack2, pack4, unpack2, unpack4</B> many values can be combined into a
single 64-bit integer and stored in the MOOD and MESSAGE registers. For example, to send 4 integers to
another cell, this code could be used:
<P>
<PRE>
	23 -999 5901 3 pack4		; combined these 4 (16-bit intgers) into single 64-bit int.
	-1 1 SEND			; send to cell

</PRE>
<P>
The reciving cell, can extract these 4 values like so:
<P>
<PRE>
	RECV
	unpack4			; the values 23, -999, 5901, 3 are now on the stack
</PRE>

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<A NAME="ref_MOOD">
<H2>MOOD</H2>
<B>Usage:</B> ( x y -- m )<P>
Every cell has its own "MOOD" register. This instruction queries another cell
using an (x, y) vector. This vector <B>is not normalized</B> which allows the cell
to query any other cell within its own organism (not just adjacent cells). For example,
if cell 2 executed the following instructions:
<PRE>
	0 0 MOOD   ; returns -23
	-1 0 MOOD   ; returns 123
	-1 1 MOOD   ; returns 33
	99 99 MOOD   ; returns 0
</PRE>
<P>
If a bogus (x, y) is specified then 0 is pushed on the data stack. (0, 0) refers to the
cell executing the instruction.
<P>
<B>ENERGY:</B> Does not use energy.

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<A NAME="ref_MOOD!">
<H2>MOOD!</H2>
<B>Usage:</B> ( m -- )<P>
The cell executing this instruction will set its own <b>mood</b> register. It is not possible
to set others. The purpose of the <b>mood</b> register is for a cell it advertise its "mood" to
other cells in the organism. For example, if cell 3 executed these instructions:
<PRE>
	0 0 MOOD 1 + MOOD!
</PRE>
Then cell 3's mood would be increased by 1. So it would be set to 34.
<P>
<B>ENERGY:</B> Does not use energy.
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<A NAME="ref_BROADCAST">
<H2>BROADCAST</H2>
<B>Usage:</B> ( m -- )<P>
This instruction takes the value off of the top of the data stack and sets the <b>message</b>
register for every cell in our organism.
<P>
<B>ENERGY:</B> Does not use energy.
<P>
<HR>
<P>

<A NAME="ref_SEND">
<H2>SEND</H2>
<B>Usage:</B> ( m x y -- )<P>
This instruction takes 3 arguments. An (x, y) vector and a value 'm'. The vector <b>is NOT
normalized</b> so that the cell can send a message 'm' to any other cell in the same organism
(not just adjacent cells). For example, if cell 1 exectuted this these two instructions:
<PRE>
	100     1 0 SEND   ; set cell 2's message register to 100
	-46812  0 1 SEND   ; set cell 3's message register to -46812
	0       0 0 SEND   ; set out message register to 0.
	12   -99 99 SEND   ; does nothing because (-99, 99) is bogus

A SEND operation using bogus coordinates will be ignored.

<A NAME="ref_RECV">

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<A NAME="ref_ENERGY">
<H2>ENERGY</H2>
<B>Usage:</B> ( -- e )<P>
Fetch the organisms "energy" field and place it on our data stack. Please be
aware that putting something on the data stack requires 1 unit of energy. So the
value placed on the data stack is BEFORE the simulator subtracts 1 unit of energy for
the data stack entry.

Also this instruction does not account for any energy that is stored in the form of stack

<B>Usage:</B> ( x y -- r )<P>
<OL>
<LI> On the data stack should be two values. If not, we ignore this instruction.

<LI> The two values are popped off the stack (they are NOT normalized).
	This forms an (x, y) vector that refers to one of our
	nearby grid locations.

<LI> If we have a cell at this (x, y) offset, then this instruction returns 1.
 Else 0 will be returned.

<LI> The vector (0,0) is allowed, and always returns 1.

</OL>
<P>
<B>RETURNS:</B>
<UL>
<LI> <B>1</B> - at offset (x, y) is one of our cells.
<LI> <B>0</B> - at offset (x, y) it NOT one of our cells.
</UL>

<B>ENERGY:</B> Does not use energy.
